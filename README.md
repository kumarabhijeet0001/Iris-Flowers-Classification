Iris Flower Classification
Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project is a machine learning task where we predict the species of an iris flower based on the dimensions of its petals and sepals. This project uses the well-known Iris dataset, which is often used as a beginnerâ€™s introduction to machine learning and classification algorithms.

Dataset
Features (Input Variables):
Sepal Length: Length of the sepal in centimeters.

Sepal Width: Width of the sepal in centimeters.

Petal Length: Length of the petal in centimeters.

Petal Width: Width of the petal in centimeters.

Target (Output Variable):
Species: One of the following three classes:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Dataset Characteristics:
Number of samples: 150

Number of features: 4

Number of classes: 3

Balanced dataset: 50 samples per class

Goal
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on the given features.

Workflow
1. Data Loading and Exploration
Load the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Visualize data to understand relationships between features and classes.

2. Data Preprocessing
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).

Normalize or scale data if required by the chosen algorithm.

3. Model Training
Train the model using various classification algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Random Forests

4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using metrics like:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

5. Visualization
Plot confusion matrices to visualize misclassifications.

Use pair plots and heatmaps to understand feature relationships.

Tools and Libraries
Python: Programming language used for implementation.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
